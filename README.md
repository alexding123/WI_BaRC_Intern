# Whitehead Institute Intern
The code and scripts written during at the Bioinformatics and Research Computing (BaRC) group under Whitehead Institute for my 2018 Project Week at Commonwealth School.

I spent my intern updating and translating old scripts on their lab server from Perl into Python. Most of them can be found here. Shoutout to Dr. George Bell for hosting me during the intern.
